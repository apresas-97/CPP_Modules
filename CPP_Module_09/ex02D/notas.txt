Things TO-DO, things TO-CHECK:

-Change naming scheme for variables to make it clearer

-Clean up debug functions
-Move every function where it belongs
-Ensure things are private or public correctly in the classes
-Ensure nothing is unusued, functions or variables
-Ensure your includes are correct
	-Each part should be completely independend, regardless of what you change in the local includes
	-Remove includes that don't really add anything

-Make the mergeInsertionSort for std::list
-Make the LIterator class

-Make sure the Makefile is correct

-Prepare the main as the subject requires

-Try to merge both concepts in a single function???? (optional, if it already works, it already works)

-Add the option for a comp function????
