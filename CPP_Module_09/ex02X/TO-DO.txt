THINGS TO DO:

- Check that all your includes are meaningful where they are included
- Verify that the naming schemes are consistent.
	-- In binarySearch you use search_range, half_range, etc.
	These should be searchRange and halfRange.
	And so on.
- In my insertElements function, the check bStart >= bSize doesn't account for the fact in b there might be
the odd element.
Meaning, sometimes, the odd element will be included in the main insertion loop, instead of being left to the
final loop for the remaining pend elements.
